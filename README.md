In 2015, I played around with using Perlin noise to generate music. Perlin noise is an interesting random distribution because it provides random numbers that have a 'mood'. The numbers close to eachother in the sequence are correlated, but overall they are random.
It was designed to make more natural looking textures in computer generated images, and I thought that might apply to music as well.
It turned out, I didn't know enough about music theory to get anything that sounded good, and I was never really able to validate my guess that perlin noise could be beautiful. I learned that making good music requires a lot more knowledge, and I ended up taking guitar lessons after this
